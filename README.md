# Code Semantic Search Experiment
This repository contains an experimental setup for performing semantic search on a code base. The goal is to enable efficient and accurate retrieval of code snippets based on natural language queries.

# Project Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up a Python virtual environment using `python -m venv .venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
